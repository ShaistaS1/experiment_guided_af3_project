# experiment_guided_af3_project
I extend experiment-guided AlphaFold3 beyond single proteins to generate dynamic, experiment-conditioned ensembles of protein–protein and protein–ligand complexes. Unlike static AF3 models, our framework integrates crosslink-MS and cryo-EM maps to reveal hidden binding pathways and conformational flexibility.
